## Chip8
Chip-8 is a simple, interpreted, programming language which was first used on some do-it-yourself computer systems in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The COSMAC VIP, DREAM 6800, and ETI 660 computers are a few examples. These computers typically were designed to use a television as a display, had between 1 and 4K of RAM, and used a 16-key hexadecimal keypad for input. The interpreter took up only 512 bytes of memory, and programs, which were entered into the computer in hexadecimal, were even smaller.

Chip-48 inspired a whole new crop of Chip-8 interpreters for various platforms, including MS-DOS, Windows 3.1, Amiga, HP48, MSX, Adam, and ColecoVision. I became involved with Chip-8 after stumbling upon Paul Robson's interpreter on the World Wide Web. Shortly after that, I began writing my own Chip-8 interpreter.

This document is a compilation of all the different sources of information I used while programming my interpreter.
